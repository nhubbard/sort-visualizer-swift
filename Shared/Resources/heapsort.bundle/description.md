In computer science, heap sort is a [comparison-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_sort) sorting algorithm. Heap sort can be thought of as an improved [selection sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort): like selection sort, heap sort divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element from it and inserting it into the sorted region. Unlike selection sort, heapsort does not waste time with a linear-time scan of the unsorted region; rather, heap sort maintains the unsorted region in a [heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)) data structure to more quickly find the largest element in each step.

Although somewhat slower in practice on most machines than a well-implemented quick sort, it has the advantage of a more favorable worst case O(n Ã— log n) runtime. Heap sort is an [in-place algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm), but it is not a [stable sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_sort).

Heap sort was invented by [J. W. J. Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._W._J._Williams) in 1964. This was also the birth of the heap, presented already by Williams as a useful data structure in its own right. In the same year, [R. W. Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Floyd) published an improved version that could sort an array in-place, continuing his earlier research into the [treesort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treesort) algorithm.
