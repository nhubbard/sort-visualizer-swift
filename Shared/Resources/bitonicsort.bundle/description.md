*From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia*

Bitonic mergesort is a parallel algorithm for sorting. It is also used as a construction method for building a [sorting network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_network). The algorithm was devised by [Ken Batcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Batcher). The resulting sorting networks consist of O(*n* × log²(*n*)) comparators and have a delay of O(log²(*n*)), where *n* is the number of items to be sorted.
