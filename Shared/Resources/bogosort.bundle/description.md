*From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia*

In computer science, bogosort (also known as permutation sort, stupid sort, or slowsort) is a sorting algorithm based on the [generate and test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generate_and_test) paradigm. The function successively generates [permutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation) of its input until it finds one that is sorted. It is not considered useful for sorting, but may be used for educational purposes, to contrast it with more efficient algorithms.

Two versions of this algorithm exist: a deterministic version that enumerates all permutations until it hits a sorted one, and a [randomized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_algorithm) version that randomly permutes its input. An analogy for the working of the latter version is to sort a deck of cards by throwing the deck into the air, picking the cards up at random, and repeating the process until the deck is sorted. Its name is a [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) of the words *bogus* and *sort*.
