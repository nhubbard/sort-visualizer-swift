*From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia*

In computer science, merge sort (also commonly spelled as mergesort) is an efficient, general-purpose, and [comparison-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_sort) sorting algorithm.

Most implementations produce a [stable sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Stability), which means that the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output.

Merge sort is a [divide-and-conquer algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm) that was invented by [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) in 1945.

A detailed description and analysis of bottom-up merge sort appeared in a report by [Herman Goldstine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Goldstine) and von Neumann as early as 1948.
