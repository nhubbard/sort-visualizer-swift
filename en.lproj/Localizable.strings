"home_copy" = "Sorting algorithms are used to sort a data structure according to a specific order relationship, such as numerical order or lexicographical order.

This operation is one of the most important and widespread in computer science. For a long time, new methods have been developed to make this procedure faster and faster.

There are hundreds of different sorting algorithms available, each with their own characteristics. They are classified according to two metrics: space complexity and time complexity.

Those two kinds of complexity are represented with asymptotic notations, mainly with the symbols O, Θ, and Ω, which represent the upper bound, the tight bound, and the lower bound of an algorithm's complexity. The numeric value of these bounds is specified in parentheses in terms of the number *n*, which is the number of elements in the data structure.

Most sorting algorithms fall into two specific categories:

* **Logarithmic**: The complexity is proportional to the binary logarithm of *n* (i.e. log₂(*n*)). An example of a logarithmic sorting algorithm is **Quick Sort**, which has space and time complexity of O(*n* log *n*).
* **Quadratic**: The complexity is proportional to the square of *n*. An example of a quadratic sorting algorithm is **Bubble Sort**, with a time complexity of O(*n*²).

There is also a third category: **Weird** algorithms. These don't follow a Logarithmic or Quadratic complexity, and are a bit more difficult to compare.

Space and time complexity can also be further subdivided into 3 different cases: best case, average case, and worst case.

Sorting algorithms can be difficult to understand, and it's easy to get confused. This app aims to help you understand sorting algorithms by showing their actions in real time. Without further ado, let's get started -- choose an algorithm from the sidebar on the left!";
